"""CAN sniffer: a read-only diagnostic that tallies raw CAN traffic per bus.

The full-payload collector preserves every frame, while its progress counters still
highlight prior SecOC hypotheses (0x0F sync and 0x2E4/0x131/0x344 protected). This
lightweight inventory independently drops every filter and counts every arbitration ID on
every bus, splitting the failure into: nothing on any bus (wiring / pin-swap), vs
traffic on a bus the oracle ignores (bus mapping), vs traffic present but sync 0x0F
absent (different sync ID, or no SecOC on this car).

Read-only: no UDS session, no TX, no key or oracle writes. Shares the panda-takeover
preamble with collect_can.py by deliberate duplication.
